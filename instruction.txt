Attached you can find a county level dataset for the US southern states with three variables ( incidence rate [ind_r], inter-county mobility[inter], intra-county mobility [intra]). There are also 7 time point for each variable and county (time=1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20,24). Could you using Python notebook to create a county level map for each variable showing the spatial distribution and temporal trend (similar to the one you created for the ODT Flow API case study)? See a sample sketch below for one variable. Please only show the counties with data. Would be great if you can work on it Thursday morning. I hope this code can be reused for producing similar maps in the future.
